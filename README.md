# Student Module-University Management System

## Project Overview

The University Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline student information management. Developed using Java Servlets, MySQL, HTML, and CSS, the project offers CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for student records. Currently, only the **Manage Student Info** module is implemented.

## Features

1. **Homepage**:  
   The main HTML page offers navigation options for managing various aspects of student data. At this stage, only the **Manage Student Info** button is functional.

2. **Manage Student Info**:  
   - Clicking **Manage Student Info** provides options to:
     - **Insert** new student records
     - **Update** existing student details
     - **Delete** records
     - **Fetch Any** specific student data
     - **Fetch All** student records
   - Each action leads to a unique form designed for that operation.
